A suite of maxforlive monome devices

Developed for Berklee ISEL-P112 Grid Performance Studies 

This collection of devices is currently under active development. Expect continual changes. 

Principles
* Optimised for 128-format grids, although other grid sizes and multiple-monome configurations may be supported
* Varibright monome grid required
* Utilizes sync via Ableton Live Link - by default, devices should stay in phase with the transport when possible
* Autofocus with LED state caching
